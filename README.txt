[Ax256] This is a personal project designed to emulate the Ax256 architecture as closely as possible to native x86 hardware on Linux.
The emulator supports all APIs for Ax256, including the BIOS and is capable of running graphics operations.

An OS designed for the Ax256 should load successfully and be able to execute programs with no error.
